# Encryption and Decryption Using Python (Caesar Cipher)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **Encryption and Decryption using Python** with the help of the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm. It is a classic cryptography technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

This project is designed for **educational purposes** to help beginners understand basic encryption concepts, string manipulation, and user input handling in Python.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a **substitution cipher** where:

* Each letter in the plaintext is shifted forward by a fixed number (key/shift)
* Decryption shifts the letters backward by the same number

Example with shift = 3:

```
Plaintext : HELLO
Ciphertext: KHOOR
```

---

## ✨ Features

* Encrypts text using Caesar Cipher
* Decrypts encrypted text
* Accepts user input for message and shift value
* Supports **uppercase and lowercase letters**
* Simple, beginner-friendly Python code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* Basic Python concepts (loops, conditionals, strings)

## 🚀 How to Run the Program (Kali Linux)

1️⃣ Open the terminal

2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd caesar_cipher
```

3️⃣ Run the program

```bash
python3 caesar_cipher.py
```

4️⃣ Enter:

* Your message
* Shift value (1–25)
* Choose whether to **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**

---

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter shift value (1-25): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
```
